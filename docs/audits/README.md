# Audit Registry

This is the authoritative entry point for adversarial-review status. Read the
first row before starting implementation; it is the latest audit. Older reports
remain as history and may contain findings that were subsequently resolved.

| ID | Date | Scope | Status | Supersedes | Open findings |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **A-004** | 2026-07-19 | [Protocol implementation](./2026-07-19-protocol-implementation.md) | **RECONCILED — all 4 findings (3 medium, 1 low) addressed 2026-07-19; re-audit to confirm** | A-003 for current implementation sign-off | None pending re-audit |
| **A-003** | 2026-07-17 | [Product-wide plan](./2026-07-17-product-wide-plan.md) | **RESOLVED — the 1 high reconciled 2026-07-18; plan signed off for the declared scope** | A-001 and A-002 for current plan sign-off | None ([addon-sdk#1](https://github.com/p2p-songs/addon-sdk/issues/1) closed) |
| A-002 | 2026-07-17 | [Core-player architecture re-audit](./2026-07-17-core-player-architecture-reaudit.md) | Resolved; historical | A-001 for core architecture | None |
| A-001 | 2026-07-17 | [Core-player plan](./2026-07-17-core-player-plan.md) | Resolved; historical | — | None |

## Current decision

A-004 audited the first implementation slice, `@p2p-songs/protocol`, and
required four changes. **All four are now reconciled (2026-07-19):** resource
URLs are restricted to `https://` via a shared schema; `meta` is a discriminated
union enforcing type↔id identity, with a new `playlist:<token>` namespace; the
standalone wire spec `addon-sdk/docs/PROTOCOL.md` (v0.1) exists; and an explicit
multi-disc + bonus-disc fixture was added (46 tests pass; typecheck + build +
built-package runtime probes green). The reconciliation is recorded in the A-004
report's Resolution section. **A re-audit is invited to confirm and move the
current implementation to signed-off.** A-003 remains the resolved plan audit.

## Reading rules

- Newest audit is the first table row, identified by the highest audit ID.
- `OPEN` means at least one finding still blocks the audit's sign-off.
- `RESOLVED` means its findings were addressed; the report remains evidence,
  not the current verdict.
- `SUPERSEDED` means a later audit owns current sign-off for that scope.
- GitHub issues track actionable high/critical findings, but this registry—not
  the issue list—is the authoritative sequence and overall verdict.
- Every new report must declare `Audit ID`, `Status`, `Supersedes`, `Audited
  commits`, and `Last updated` directly below its title, then update this table.
